## Data
There is a many to many relationship between links and categories.  To bootstrap the data you can run these scripts in this order.
1. data/create.py  Create the database  This script will drop all tables before creating
2. data/populate_user.py  Create a user
3. data/import_categories.py  Import categories from categories.csv
4. data/populate_links.py Add links their categories

If you want to manually delete data from tables, open a SQL window (pgAdmin 4)
`delete from delete from link_category`
`delete from categories`
`delete from links`
`delete from users`
